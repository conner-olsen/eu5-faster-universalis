[h1]Overview:[/h1]
Dramatically improves gameplay speed/tick rate through dozens of changes while maintaining vanilla balance and gameplay.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[olist]
 [*][b]100%+ Faster Game Speed:[/b] On 5 speed, you should see time pass around double the vanilla speed (if it took 60 seconds for a year to pass on 5-speed vanilla, it will take 30 seconds on this mod). This difference is even greater at lower speeds. For reference, in my testing, Daily Ticks on 5-speed increased game speed by 12.92%, where as the Steam page video shows, Faster Universalis increased game speed by 102.12% on a late-game vanilla save.
    [list]
     [*]Accomplished through dozens of defines changes that would be too many to list here.
     [*]Removed hourly ticks
     [*]Combat, Movement Speed, Game & AI Update Frequency, have all been adjusted so that all outcomes and game balance should be identical to vanilla. You should not notice any difference besides the faster speed.
    [/list]
 [*][b]Optional Performance Optimization Game Rules:[/b]
  [list]
   [*][b]Pop-Based Nation Culling[/b] Deletes Pop-Based Nations in regions without any regular nations. See the mod page screenshot for a comparison to vanilla.
   [*][b]Region Removals:[/b] Europe Centric, Asia Centric, and Remove Low-Importance Regions. See the mod page screenshots for what each will look like.
    [list]
     [*][b]Remove Low-Importance Regions:[/b] Deletes Minor Nations in regions with little chance of interaction, such as small Pacific island nations—full details in the game rule descriptions.
     [*][b]Europe Centric:[/b] Effectively a Europe-only game, removing far away regions such as East Asia, Indonesia, & Oceania.
     [*][b]Asia Centric:[/b] Effectively an Asia-only game, removing faraway regions such as Europe & West Africa.
    [/list]

[h1]Planned/Upcoming:[/h1]
[olist]
 [*][b]Continued Performance Optimization:[/b] I will be continuing to optimize the mod for performance as I find more opportunities.
 [*][b]Additional Customization:[/b] Allow adjusting combat speed and movement speed through game rules. Feel free to suggest other settings you would like to see.
 [*][b]Graphics Tweak Options:[/b] I have been working on improving rendering/FPS performance as well, which will be released in a future update. But as of now, I've only managed a 13% increase in FPS. (If you like, you can uncomment out my WIP graphics defines, but it is not currently enabled by default.) Note that if you are CPU-bound, you may still see a FPS boost currently. And you will see an FPS boost using any of the optional performance game rules in certain scenes, as there will be less to render.
