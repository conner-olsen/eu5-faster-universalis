[h1]Overview:[/h1]
Dramatically improves game speed/tick rate while maintaining vanilla balance and gameplay.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
[olist]
 [*][b]100%+ Faster Game Speed:[/b] On 5 speed, you should see time pass around twice as fast as vanilla, and an even greater improvement on lower speeds.
    [list]
     [*]Accomplished through dozens of defines changes that would be too many to list here.
     [*]Removed hourly ticks (and goes beyond, with the base mod using 1.9 day (47 hour) ticks. But can be adjusted through [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3662955914]submods available here.[/url])
     [*]Combat, Movement Speed, Game & AI Update Frequency, have all been adjusted so that all outcomes and game balance should be identical to vanilla. You should not notice any difference besides the faster speed.
    [/list]
 [*][b]Optional Performance Optimization Game Rules:[/b]
  [list]
   [*][b]Pop-Based Nation Removal:[/b] Deletes All Pop-Based Nations.
   [*][b]Region Removals:[/b] Europe Centric, Asia Centric, and Remove Low-Importance Regions. See the mod page screenshots for what each will look like.
    [list]
     [*][b]Remove Low-Importance Regions:[/b] Deletes Minor Nations in regions with little chance of interaction, such as small Pacific island nations—full details in the game rule descriptions.
     [*][b]Europe Centric:[/b] Effectively a Europe-only game, removing far away regions such as East Asia, Indonesia, & Oceania.
     [*][b]Asia Centric:[/b] Effectively an Asia-only game, removing faraway regions such as Europe & West Africa.
    [/list]
   [*][b]Unowned Pop Removal:[/b] Deletes pops in unowned locations. Stacks with nation removal.
   [*][b]Block Recolonization:[/b] If enabled with the Europe Centric or Asia Centric removals, prevents recolonization of the removed regions. Turning this off can create an interesting experience of the scramble to recolonize the lost old world.
  [/list]
 [*][b]Speed Adjustment Game Rules[/b]
  [list]
   [*][b]Army Movement Speed:[/b] Allows you to adjust army movement speed.
   [*][b]Navy Movement Speed:[/b] Allows you to adjust navy movement speed.
   [*][b]Battle Length:[/b] Allows you to adjust how long battles will last (while losses/outcomes remain the same as vanilla).
  [/list]
 [*][b]Minor QoL Adjustments:[/b]
   [*][b]Doubled MP Event Timeout Time[/b]
[/olist]

For reference, in my testing, Daily Ticks on 5-speed increased game speed by about 13%, where as the Steam page video shows, Faster Universalis without any optional optimizations enabled, increased game speed by about 100% on a late-game vanilla save. With the optional optimizations enabled, such as Pop-Based Nation Culling, and Europe-centric regions, you can see improvements of over 200%.

[h1]Planned/Upcoming:[/h1]
[olist]
 [*][b]Continued Performance Optimization:[/b] I will be continuing to optimize the mod for performance as I find more opportunities.
 [*][b]Additional Customization:[/b] Allow adjusting combat speed and movement speed through game rules. Feel free to suggest other settings you would like to see.
 [*][b]Graphics Tweak Options:[/b] I have been working on improving rendering/FPS performance as well, which will be released in a future update. But as of now, I've only managed a 13% increase in FPS. (If you like, you can uncomment out my WIP graphics defines, but it is not currently enabled by default.) Note that if you are CPU-bound, you may still see a FPS boost currently. And you will see an FPS boost using any of the optional performance game rules in certain scenes, as there will be less to render.

[h1]Change Log:[/h1]
See the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/changelog/$item-id$]Change Notes on the workshop page[/url].

[h1]Compatibility:[/h1]
[list]
 [*]Supports v1.0.11 and the v1.1 beta.
 [*]Not Achievement Compatible.
 [*]Fully save game compatible.
 [*]Should not be used with any other tick-change mod, such as Daily Ticks.
 [*]I may add compatibility patches upon request.
[/list]

[h1]Additional Notes[/h1]
To be compatible with both v1.0.11 and the v1.1 beta, I haven't adjusted the delay between ticks. This means that while 5-speed is 2x faster than vanilla, the other speeds are disproportionately faster, such as 1-speed being 23.5x faster than vanilla. But you can also use the speed adjustment [url=https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=3662955914]submods available here for your respective game version.[/url]) When v1.1 is released, the speed adjustment submods will be merged into the main mod.

Please report any issues or outcomes that don't match vanilla/expected behavior if they occur.

In addition to the comment section, you can also ask any questions, report bugs, or make suggestions in the [url=https://discord.gg/zeQ6x9wrPq]#faster-universalis channel of the EU5 Community discord server[/url]. And if you are interested in joining in the development of this or one of my other mods, you can ping or add me on Discord @arealconner. All contributions are welcome.
